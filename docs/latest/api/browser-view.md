# BrowserView

A `BrowserView` can be used to embed additional web content into a
[`BrowserWindow`](latest/api/browser-window.md). It is like a child window, except that it is positioned
relative to its owning window. It is meant to be an alternative to the
`webview` tag.

### Example

```javascript
// In the main process.
const { app, BrowserView, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

  const view = new BrowserView()
  win.setBrowserView(view)
  view.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300 })
  view.webContents.loadURL('https://electronjs.org')
})
```
